# Supabase Functions & Configuration

This directory contains Supabase Edge Functions and CLI configuration.

## Important Security Note

**DO NOT commit the `.temp/` directory to version control!**

The `.temp/` directory contains sensitive project-specific configuration:
- `project-ref` - Your Supabase project ID
- `pooler-url` - Database connection URL with credentials
- Other version and configuration files

These files are automatically generated by the Supabase CLI and are specific to your local environment and project.
