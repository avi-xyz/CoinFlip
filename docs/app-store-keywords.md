## Tips for App Store Connect

1. **Don't repeat words** from your app name or subtitle
   - "CoinFlip" already in name, don't use
   - "Crypto Trading Simulator" in subtitle, avoid duplication

2. **Use commas, no spaces**
   - Correct: `crypto,bitcoin,trading`
   - Wrong: `crypto, bitcoin, trading`

3. **Lowercase only**
   - App Store converts to lowercase anyway

4. **Order doesn't matter**
   - Apple's algorithm treats all equally
   - Order shown above is for readability only

5. **Localize if needed**
   - These keywords are for English (US)
   - Consider Spanish, Chinese, etc. for global reach
